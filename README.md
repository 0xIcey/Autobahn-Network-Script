# Autobahn-Network-Script

This repository contains a script that is used to wash a car on the Autobahn Network. 

# Setup

The pre-compiled exe is now available for all platforms.

If you defined one or more token id's in the config, the program will set up to automatically execute once per day, to keep your car clean for you.
Make sure your wallets contains enough gas money.
(One car costs about 0.00001 TXL to wash)

SETTING INVALID TOKENS MIGHT LEAD TO LOSS OF GAS COST!!

If you do end up finding this tool helpful, I'd appreciate a small tip!^^
